# hello-world
I am creating this repository for the sole purpose of learning to use git, and github

I am currently a Literature student in Kalayaan College, and I'm focusing on a computer science/math based curriculum for future projects of mine.
I am 19 years old, and I prefer to use vim over emacs.
